This repo contains my codes for Multi-Object Tracking in a Lacrosse Game

## Introduction: Multiple Object Tracking 

Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) is the problem of automatically identifying multiple objects in a video and representing them as a set of trajectories with high accuracy.

## Goal: MOT in Lacrosse Game

Lacrosse is competitive sport in which two teams of players use long-handled, racketlike implements (crosses) to catch, carry, or throw a ball down the field or into the opponents' goal.

## Proposed Solution

Our solution requires three parts:

- Object detection to detect players
- Object tracker to track trajectories of players in the video
- Define Metrics of how well each player is playing
